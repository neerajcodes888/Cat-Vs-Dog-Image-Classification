# Cat-Vs-Dog-Image-Classification


## Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify images as either a cat or a dog. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled cat and dog images and uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset, divided into subdirectories for training and testing images.
- `src/`: The source code for the image classification model.
  - `train_model.py`: Script to train the machine learning model.
  - `predict.py`: Script to make predictions on new images using the trained model.
- `models/`: This directory stores the trained machine learning model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9 or more
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Dataset Preparation: Make sure to download and organize the dataset into the data/ directory. You can use a dataset like the Kaggle Cats and Dogs dataset.

Training the Model:

python src/train_model.py
This script will train the model on the provided dataset and save the trained model in the models/ directory.
python src/predict.py path/to/test/image.jpg
Replace path/to/test/image.jpg with the path to the image you want to classify.

# Results
