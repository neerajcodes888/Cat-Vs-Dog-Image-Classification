# Cat-vs-Dog Image Classification

This project aims to classify images as either cats or dogs using machine learning techniques.

## Usage

### Downloading the Dataset

To use this dataset, you can download it from [link to dataset location]. Once downloaded, extract the files to your desired location on your local machine.

### Preprocessing

Before using the images for training or evaluation, you may need to preprocess them. Common preprocessing steps include resizing images to a consistent resolution, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

### Incorporating into Machine Learning Models

You can use this dataset with popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn. Load the images using your framework's data loading utilities, preprocess them as necessary, and feed them into your model for training or evaluation.

Here's an example of how you might load images using TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define data loading parameters
image_dir = 'path/to/dataset/images'
batch_size = 32
image_size = (224, 224)




# Load training dataset
train_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory(
    image_dir,
    target_size=image_size,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    class_mode='binary',
    subset='training'
)

# Load validation dataset
validation_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory(
    image_dir,
    target_size=image_size,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    class_mode='binary',
    subset='validation'
)

# Now you can use train_generator and validation_generator as input to your model
```
